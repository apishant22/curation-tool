You are an AI assistant equipped with web search capabilities, tasked with creating comprehensive profiles of women in computer science. Your goal is to provide a detailed narrative that highlights their involvement in conferences, workshops, and events, focusing less on academic papers unless they are directly related to such events. Utilize your web search function for real-time information retrieval, ensuring that the data pertains to the correct individual by cross-referencing details provided in the prompt. Always include the source URL for any information obtained from the web to verify authenticity.

The profile should be structured into coherent sections where appropriate, such as "Biography," "Conference Involvement," "Awards and Recognitions," and "Impact on the Field." Avoid using lists or bullet points unless it enhances clarity or is absolutely necessary. Aim for a narrative style that is engaging and informative, providing at least 400 words in markdown format.

Ensure the profiles are informative by highlighting:
- Key conferences, symposiums, or workshops they have organized, chaired, or spoken at.
- Significant contributions to major events in the field of computer science.
- Notable collaborations and partnerships related to conference activities.
- Any leadership roles held within professional organizations or events.
- Contributions to the development and promotion of diversity and inclusion within the industry through event participation.

Remember to focus on web search findings, integrating them seamlessly with any given details to enrich the profile without redundancy. Omit any mention of missing information to maintain a positive and informative tone.

#### Name: Adriana Wilde

**Summary:**  
Adriana is a Lecturer in Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton, where she has recently returned as a member of the new Digital Health and Biomedical Engineering research group. She has been a dedicated technology educator for over 30 years, charting a very unconventional path in her discipline. Her professional journey began in 1991 as a teaching assistant in the school where she was pursuing her "Licenciatura" in Computer Science (a 5-year honors degree) at the Universidad Central de Venezuela. Ever since, she has continued to pursue her passion for technology and education. Adriana went on to gain several postgraduate qualifications, including an MSc in Computer Science (a joint master from the universities of Bern, Fribourg, and Neuchatel in Switzerland), a Postgraduate Certificate in Education for Post-Compulsory Education and Training (from the University of Southampton), and, more recently, a PhD in Computer Science, also from Southampton. Her expertise lies in diverse areas such as computer science education, digital health, and human-computer interaction.  
A long-standing member of the ACM (from 2014, having won an ACM-W scholarship to attend the ICST 2013 in New Zealand), Adriana has actively participated in the organization since. She was the treasurer of the former UK and Ireland Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education chapter (UKI SIGCSE) in 2018. She has also been part of the year-on-year success of one of the most important of ACM-W Europe’s initiatives, the celebration of women in computing, womENcourage™, where she served as poster chair and member of the steering committee for several years, liaising with hosts, supporters, reviewers, and applicants throughout Europe and beyond.  
Over the years, Adriana’s dedication to promoting diversity in technology has shone brightly. She is deeply committed to fostering inclusivity and equality in the discipline. In addition to her roles with ACM, she has actively championed diversity initiatives at both the University of St Andrews and the University of Southampton.

#### Name: Yuqing Melanie Wu

**Summary:**  
Melanie studied computer science at Peking University as an undergraduate student. She later received an MS degree in Computer Science from Indiana University, Bloomington, before moving to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, to continue her graduate education towards a PhD degree in computer science under the guidance of Prof. H.V. Jagadish, who she found a "dream advisor" in being always helpful, encouraging, and caring. After several internships at industry research labs, she decided that academia was where she belonged. In the decade following her PhD, she established her career at Indiana University Bloomington. At IUB, she was one of the few female professors in the department—and even fewer were not white.  
She actively participated in and led Women in Computing (WIC) activities in Informatics and Computer Science, receiving the "Advisor of the Year" award and "Inspirational Teacher" award. Embracing her passion for teaching and mentoring, she later moved her career to Pomona College and has been there since.  
In 2012, Valeria Barr, then chair of ACM-W, invited Melanie to join ACM-W. Melanie chaired the communication committee for seven years before assuming the role of treasurer in 2019. In her academic life, Melanie has gone from success to success. Currently, she serves as the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of College at Pomona College, one of the top liberal arts colleges in the US.

#### Name: Lauren Cairco Dukes

**Summary:**
Lauren Cairco Dukes was a software engineer at Area 120, Google’s in-house incubator until the entire Area 120 organization was cut as a part of Google’s layoffs in January 2023. Lauren earned her BS in Computer Science at Winthrop University, where her liberal arts education gave her the time and space to pursue many other interests, including music, writing, and biblical studies. Her interdisciplinary interests continued through her MS and PhD at Clemson University, where she conducted human-computer interaction research for healthcare training in virtual reality and taught undergraduate courses. This broad range of interests and experiences prepared her well for a flexible career within Alphabet, where she’s worked from the very bottom of the technical stack on Search Performance to the very top of the stack doing UX research, design, and technical leadership for an open-source electronic medical record app, MedTimeLine. In addition to Lauren’s technical work, Lauren served as the site lead for her office’s annual month of community service emphasis and mentored new hires. Lauren also stepped down to 80% time and is an advocate for workplace flexibility.

Outside of work, most of Lauren’s time is spent chasing her two-year-old around! When she has time, she volunteers with her church’s nonprofit for disadvantaged entrepreneurs, plays recreational kickball, weight lifts with an intergenerational group of women, and plays board games.
