An optional survey gathered positive feedback from all 26 respondents regarding their motivation and understanding. These findings highlight the positive impact of inclusive approaches in programming education, warranting further exploration in larger settings.', 'Publication Date': '07/09/2023'}, {'Title': 'Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion in the CS Curriculum', 'DOI': '10.1145/3610969.3611125', 'Abstract': 'The computing discipline has long-standing issues in equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI). Here we reflect on a curriculum review, embedding diversity-related learning outcomes to meet accreditation requirements by Professional, Statutory and Regulatory Bodies. We give examples of local initiatives, which have been successful in improving the environment for women in computing, women in science, engineering and technology, as well as LGBTQ+ people. Their success can be brought into the classroom, with accreditation acting as the catalyst for such change in the CS curriculum.', 'Publication Date': '07/09/2023'}, {'Title': 'LIVE: the Human Role in Learning in Immersive Virtual Environments', 'DOI': '10.1145/3357251.3357590', 'Abstract': 'This work studies the role of a human instructor within an immersive VR lesson. Our system allows the instructor to perform “contact teaching” by demonstrating concepts through interaction with the environment, and the student to experiment with interaction prompts. We conducted a between-subjects user study with two groups of students: one experienced the VR lesson while immersed together with an instructor; the other experienced the same contents demonstrated through animation sequences simulating the actions that the instructor would take. Results show that the Two-User version received significantly higher scores than the Single-User version in terms of overall preference, clarity, and helpfulness of the explanations. When immersed together with an instructor, users were more inclined to engage and progress further with the interaction prompts, than when the instructor was absent. Based on the analysis of videos and interviews, we identified design recommendations for future immersive VR educational experiences.', 'Publication Date': '19/10/2019'}, {'Title': 'HCI and the educational technology revolution #HCIEd2018: a workshop on video-making for teaching and learning human-computer interaction', 'DOI': '10.1145/3206505.3206600', 'Abstract': 'Over the years, the HCI Educators series has studied a number of challenges for the teaching and learning of Human-Computer Interaction at a time of radical educational change. Though video has historically played an important part on the teaching and development of HCI, only recently video-making and editing technologies have become accessible in an unprecedented way, allowing students to become proficient video "prosumers" (producers and consumers). Further, there are numerous educational gains to be had through these technologies. Through a very interactive workshop we explore how can video be used in practice to leverage skills and foster creativity whilst facilitating knowledge acquisition.', 'Publication Date': '29/05/2018'}, {'Title': 'Video coursework: opportunity and challenge for HCI education', 'DOI': '10.1145/3206505.3206596', 'Abstract': 'Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a challenging subject to study due to its highly multidisciplinary nature and the fast change of advancing technology. Keeping pace with these changes requires innovation in pedagogical approach, such as student-authored video, which is presented here. In case studies from two UK universities, students were assessed on video making. The results suggest increased student engagement and satisfaction, as well as acquisition of design skills taught in HCI, not typically taught elsewhere in computer science. Here we share our experiences of using this practice along with key challenges and some preliminary findings from analysis of the student artefact-creation process. We also outline future research directions in this space.', 'Publication Date': '29/05/2018'}, {'Title': 'Autonomy is the key: from smart towards intelligent textiles', 'DOI': '10.1145/2968219.2968558', 'Abstract': 'Electronic textiles become smart by embedding circuits and sensors which offer some passive or active capabilities. Smart textiles become intelligent due to their computational abilities allowing awareness of their environment, extract input data from it, and consequently demonstrate untaught behaviours. Intelligent systems require machine intelligence through artificial intelligence algorithms to complete these input data manipulations. However, producing intelligent electronic textiles is a current research challenge. Hypothesising their eventuality and ubiquity, challenges such as remote communication, power generation, data processing, security, and ethics arise. In what remains we focus on the ethical implications and approaches to risk mitigation.', 'Publication Date': '12/09/2016'}]}
